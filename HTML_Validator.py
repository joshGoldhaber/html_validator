    # HINT:
    # use the _extract_tags function below to generate a list of html tags without any extra text;
    # then process these html tags using the balanced parentheses algorithm from the stack.py file.
    # The main difference between your code and the code from class will be that you will have to keep track of not just the 3 types of parentheses,
    # but arbitrary text located between the html tags.

    By convention in Python, helper functions that are not meant to be used directly by the user are prefixed with an underscore.

    This function returns a list of all the html tags contained in the input string,
    stripping out all text not contained within angle brackets.
